# Car-Data-Project
This my college coursework i've done back in 2018/2019. 
It is a simple project which uses python GUI system tkinter to do a database to store user details for workers in a garage.
It also is able to allow managers/owners to add new workers to the system and input all current jobs on cars they are doing. 
The managers/owners are also able to allocate jobs to certain workers.

Feel free to use this program as i don't have any use to it.
When first loading it will create a new database under the name of Pro.db
It will store the login details of:

Username: 1000000

Password: admin
